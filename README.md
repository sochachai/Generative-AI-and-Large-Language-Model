Goals:
1. Explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering.
2. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, discover how prompt engineering and parameter tuning can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models FLAN-T5 in a AWS cloud environment
3. Fine tuning LLM
4. Aligning LLM with human values
